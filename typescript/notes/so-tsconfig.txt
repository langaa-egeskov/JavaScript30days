Thought my tsconfig was broken, but if running tsc with a specific file that is 
apparently just expected behavior.

note that everything is working in vscode if run directely from 
the typescript/
typescript
    |__node_modules
    |__notes
    |__src
    |__test
    |__tsconfig.json
    |__package.json

What I should have read first
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html

works find to just pass the -target es on the command line like so 
npx tsc --target es file.ts

Your file tsconfig.json is ignored when you specify app.ts in the command line.

In tsconfig.json, add a section exclude after the compiler options:

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
  },
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
Then, just run: tsc.
